      <p class="norm_text">As a mechanical engineering student at the University of Toronto, I experienced instruction in more than just theoretical knowledge - many courses have allowed me to experience professional strategies and best practices. </p>
      <p class="norm_text">The development of my professional skills, including collaboration, time/resource management, and technical report writing, accompanied the deliverables from these courses, including documents such as Team Charters, Project Requirements, and Conceptual Design Specification reports. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> Inline with learning Solidworks Computer Assisted Design was a three month long group project to design an affordable robotic cinematography assistance for beginner filmmakers. Current robotic cinematography arms are priced at upwards of $70 000USD, significantly out of budget for cinematographers starting out, and thus our target was to fully design and CAD an affordable alternative, taking into consideration all aspects of manufacturability, dynamics/statics calculations, and effectiveness as a cinematograph aid.

        <p class="norm_text">A psychology case study was presented to us by a group from St. Lawrence College, and we were given the oppportunity to develop a solution/aid. Micheal, a 47 year old male suffered a traumatic brain injury due to a motorcycle incident. As a direct result, his ability to complete daily tasks and operate independently has been diminished, leading to him lashing out in anger towards his family. Our task was to develop a tool to assist in Micheal's gradual recovery and that helps address his outbursts. </p>
