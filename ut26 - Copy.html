      <p class="norm_text">Since its inception in 1997, the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team (<a href="https://fsaeutoronto.ca">UTFR</a>) has undertaken the task of guilding a formula-style open-wheel race car from scratch annually. We compete in FSAE competitions in the United States as well as europe, specifically in the electric vehicle division. With the 2025-2026 season, our focus is zoned in on effectively implementing four-wheel drive, as well as optimizing many driverless (DV) assemblies, reducing mass and improving general efficiency.  </p>
      <p class="norm_text">As a senior member in the newly consolidated vehicle controls subsection (encompassing manual and autonomous steering and brakes), my primary focus is to strengthen technical vehicle performance and deepen my exposure to industry design workflows and software processes. Additionally, as new recruits filter into the team, I also contribute to team development by helping train incoming recruits and implementing systematic knowledge transfer through theory-based briefings and practical exercises. </p>

        <p class="norm_text"> As a part of optimizing our DV/autonomous systems, our DV steering system has been revamped from the early-stage iteration last year's chain drive, to a much more low profile and easy maintence shaft-coupled motor. To facilitate this, I was responsible for generating and optimizing an mount to couple the DV steering motor, the iterated custom steering rack, and the vehicle chassis.

		<li> Topology repair and model cleanup using Ansys SpaceClaim to allow for mesh generation of a STEP file of the design for finite element analysis (FEA) </li>
        <li> FEA through Ansys Workbench/Mechanical to ensure equivalent (von Mises) stress and deformation visualizations to ensure sufficently high safety factor (2) in operation as well as well as consideration of fatigue failure</li>
		<li> Benchmark iterated designs with 100MPa to account for and prevent fatigue failure throughout operation of the generally more volatile mount design, as additive metalurgy with AlSi10mg is required </li>
