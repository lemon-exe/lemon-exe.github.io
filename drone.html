      <p class="norm_text">With my joining of multiple design teams in my first year studying engineering at the University of Toronto, I had the chance to interact with many design pipelines and best practices for realizing a project from inception. Thus, during my first year's winter break, I commenced my own design project - a 7'' quadcopter remote-controlled drone. Ensuring that I had the full experience of a project, I experienced all aspects of the design process, including brainstorming, iterated candidate designs, design process documentation, CAD/digital modelling, manufacturing, prototyping, and a mind-breaking amount of troubleshooting both electronics and firmware. </p>
      <p class="norm_text">Though still definitely a work-in-progress, the current iteration of the drone flies relatively well and stable, being in flight manuverable and able to land smoothly repeatedly. The next major steps include optimizing (for mass and stiffness) the four motor arms and baseplate by transitioning to thin carbon fiber, as well as revamping battery mounting for better stability and safety.</p>
	  <p class="norm_text">Manufacturing currently paused due to my inability to effectively flash firmware to my Ender3 3D printer without bricking it :(</p>

        <p class="norm_text"> The third major iteration of the quadcopter, v3 leverages its new compliant TPU landing gear and major D-type filters to take off and stabalize better. This design also finally fixes the issue of a vibrating frame when idling on the ground, as its landing gear can absorb the slight but compounding vibrations generated naturally from the spinning motors. 
		</p>
		<p class="norm_text"> Next steps involve improving the arm effectiveness using warjet carbon fibre sheets and battery location to lower center of gravity.
		</p>
		<p class="norm_text"> The designation, <em>Fork</em>, comes from the inspiration of the shock absorber designs being motorcycle fork covers.

Note the ^ shaped D-TERM Notch in the right chart, specifically configured to rectify the Max Noise of 105Hz from the first blackbox feedback. The change was in tuning filters and a new compliant landing mechanisms; it was implemented and documented August 27th, 2025

          <p>Some more visualization of the change from the previous slide, note that the motor commands after iteration were much more in sync, rather than the sort of crowding and interfering commands of before. Additionally, the gyroscope telemetry was much more stable (and realistic) in the improved design. </p>

        <p class="norm_text">No design is constructed perfectly from the very first iteration, even those designed by the ever-so-perfect myself. The two major previous prototypes are displayed below. Though these design choices and concerns are detailed in the engineering notebook, a brief, high-level overview is presented here.</p>
		
		<p class="norm_text">Additionally, many individual components have gone over iterations as well as a result of significant faults that could be relieved without making major revisions to the current design. </p>

          <p>The first design was focused solely on getting something up in the air. The entire frame was print-in-plane and required no assembly at all. This design, though it was able to hover for a very limited time, encountered many issues, including strong frame vibrations, weak/inflexible landing gear, poor soldering, and eventually accidentally severing a radio signal wire with its propeller due to faulty wire management. Nicknamed <em>Rabbit</em> for its antennae looking like rabbit ears. </p>
        </div>
		<div class="slide"> <img src="assets/images/drone/drone_prev_2.png" alt="Image 1">
          <p>The second iteration aimed to be able to lift off more smoothly, while protecting its internals to not have any construction failures like the first did. This model still printed the large part of its frame, only have separate landing gear/feet to support. Additionally, the battery holder was improved from just tape to a solid PLA cage assembly, and Python MatplotLib was used to plot and analyze motor and telemetry functions. The frame initially held four walls for electronics protection, but eventually were found to be inefficient, and the bowing of the large frame was fixed by stacking an inverted frame beneath, earning its designation, <em>Pancake</em>.</p>

          <p>The currently operating design, this iteration is more aimed towards optimizing landing and takeoff smoothness, as well as modularlity of the drone to allow for more flexible redesigning. Additionally, the implementation of signficant analysis tools such as the blackbox viewer and frequency analysis map, allowed for better problem identification. The usage of more materials, such as TPU, stainless steel fasteners, and eventually carbon fibre allowed for a more targeted design for each component. The design of the landing gear, inspired by motorcycle fork covers, led to the nickname <em>Fork</em>.

          <p>Some design iterations of individual components. Some components, such as the battery holders, were iterated along with the entire drone design, while other such as the landing gear and motor arms sometimes were iterated within the same overall design, highlighting the importance of the modularity introduced by v2 and improved on by v3. </p>
